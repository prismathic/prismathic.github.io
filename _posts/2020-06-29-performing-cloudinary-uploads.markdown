### Basic Requirements

* A Cloudinary account. Sign up [here][cloudinary-signup] if you do not have one
* Node.js and Vue-CLI installed on your system

### What is Cloudinary?

<!-- Enter cloudinary Logo here -->
> Cloudinary is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform for executing realtime image processing and delivery. An advantage of using Cloudinary in your applications is that is makes use of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for serving images thus increasing site speed and performance. Cloudinary also handles storage for all media types so you don't have to worry about storing them on your server and consuming memory.

### What are we trying to achieve?

> In this post, we will be uploading an image to Cloudinary from a Vue.js frontend and then saving the link to the image in a MySQL database by sending a `POST` request to a backend API bulit with Node and Express.

### Let's Begin...
<!-- Insert Shall we GIF here -->

First, let's start by creating a simple API endpoint to store the image link in our database.

* Create a new project folder and name it `backend` (you can give it any name you want really)
* Open up a terminal in the folder and run `npm init --force` to initialize our package manager. The `--force` attribute is for initializing our `package.json` file with the default requirements.
* Now we need to install the dependencies we will be using for our API:
{% highlight javascript %}
npm install --save express cors sequelize body-parser
{% endhighlight %}
We'll be using `sequelize` for creating our database models (files to help you structure your data and your interaction with the database), `cors` for allowing the frontend to communicate with our API from a different port, and `body-parser` for getting data from the body of the request.
* Create a subfolder called `config` and enter the following in `config/db.js`

{% highlight javascript %}

const Sequelize = require('sequelize');


const sequelize = new Sequelize('images', 'root', null, {
  host: 'localhost',
  dialect: 'mysql'
});

module.exports = sequelize;


{% endhighlight %}

* Create another subfolder named `models` and enter the following in `models/image.js`:
{% highlight javascript %}

const sequelize = require('../config/db');
const { DataTypes } = require('sequelize');

const Image = sequelize.define('Image', {
    id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        primaryKey: true,
        autoIncrement: true,
    },
    url: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING
    },
});

module.exports = Image


{% endhighlight %}

* We can now create the entry point for our API. Create a file named `app.js` in the root of your directory and enter the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
var express = require('express')
var cors = require('cors')
var Image = require('../models/image')


var app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("API running on port 3000")
})

app.post('/images', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        let { url } = req.body

        let newImage = await Image.create({
            url
        })

        res.send(200, `Your new image has been created and the url is ${newImage.url}`)
    } catch(err) {
        console.error(err)
        res.send(500, "Internal Server Error")
    }
})


{% endhighlight %}

We have now created a simple API endpoint for posting a Cloudinary image URL to our database. You can now proceed to setting upload presets on your Cloudinary account:

When uploading to cloudinary, you'll want to set certain parameters for how your uploads should be transformed/optimized, the folder you want to upload to and many more options.
* First, log in to Cloudinary and copy your `API Base URL` from the dashboard. It's somewhat of this sort: `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/*YOUR-CLOUDINARY-USERNAME*`
* The next thing you want to do is to add an unsigned upload preset. This will enable us to upload to cloudinary directly from the browser:
    - Click the settings(âš™) icon on your dashboard, and from there, proceed to the "Upload" tab.
     ![Cloudinary Upload](/assets/cloudinary-settings.PNG)
    - Scroll to the bottom where you would see the "Upload Presets" option. Unlock a new unsigned preset and copy the name of this unsigned preset to your dashboard (for the purpose of this tutorial, we will not be making any additional configurations)

<!-- This is where you have the cloudinary screenshots and what-not -->

Finally, we can proceed to scaffolding out the frontend of our application. We will use `Vue-CLI` to create a new Vue.js project.

* Open your terminal in a new directory and run `vue create frontend` to roll out a new project for your frontend
* Next, run the following command to install the dependencies we will be using:

{% highlight javascript %}
npm install --save axios
{% endhighlight %}
We will be using `axios` for making API requests to our backend.

* We will be using `bootstrap` for styling so include it in the head section of `public/index.html`:
{% highlight html %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous" />
{% endhighlight %}

* Create a new file in the `src/components` subdirectory named `Upload.vue` and copy the following into the file:

{% highlight html %}

<template>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="col-md-6 mx-auto">
      <form @submit="uploadImage()">
          <div class="form-group">
              <label for="uploadInput">Upload your image here</label>
              <input @change="onFileChange" type="file" placeholder="Choose an image" required ref="file" name="" id="uploadInput" class="form-control">
          </div>
          <div class="form-group">
              <button class="btn-block">
                  Upload!
              </button>
          </div>
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

{% endhighlight %}

We just created a form to call a function named `uploadImage` when submitted.

* Now, edit `src/App.vue` to include the component you just created:

{% highlight html %}

<template>
  <div id="app">
    <h4>VUE IMAGE UPLOADER</h4>
    <hr>
    <Upload/>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Upload from './components/Upload.vue'

export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    Upload
  }
}
</script>

<style>

#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
</style>

{% endhighlight %}

* If you followed the above steps correctly, we would have this as our application frontend now:

![Cloudinary Upload](/assets/image-uploader.PNG)

* The next thing is to add our methods into the file's script:

{% highlight javascript %}

<script>

import axios from 'axios'

export default {
    name: "Upload",
    data() {
        return {
            image: null
        }
    },
    methods: {
        onFileChange(e) {
            var files = e.target.files || e.dataTransfer.files;
            if (!files.length)
                return;
            this.image = files[0];
        },
        uploadImage() {
            let formData = new FormData();
            let uploadPreset = "YOUR-UPLOAD-PRESET"
            let cloudinaryUrl = "CLOUDINARY-API-BASE-URL"

            formData.append('file', this.image);
            formData.append('upload_preset', uploadPreset)

            axios.post(cloudinaryUrl, formData)
            .then(res => {
                let imageUrl = res.data.secure_url;

                return axios.post(`http://localhost:3000/images`, {
                    url: imageUrl
                })
                .then(res => {
                    alert(res.data)
                })
                .catch(err => {
                    console.log(err)
                })
            })
            .catch(err => {
                console.log(err)
            })
        }
    }
}
</script>

{% endhighlight %}

Let us carefully consider the steps followed in the script:
 1. We created a function (`onFileChange`) for adding the image to the `image` property when the user selects a file. 
 2. We created a new instance of the `formData` API and stored the image properties and the upload preset in that instance.
 3. We executed a `POST` request to the Cloudinary API base URL we copied earlier with a body of `formData`.
 4. We retrieved the newly uploaded image's URL from the `secure_url` property of the response object and we posted that to our API backend listening on port 3000

 Having done that, you can check your cloudinary dashboard and you'll see your new image uploaded there.
